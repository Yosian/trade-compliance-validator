## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Intelligent Document Processing Pipeline**
```
📁 S3 Document Upload → 🔀 File Selector → 👁️ Claude Vision Processor → 📊 DynamoDB Results
                             ↓                        ↓
                     🚨 SQS Queues           🔍 Complete Audit Trail
```

### **Two-Stage AI Processing** (Cost Optimization)
```
Stage 1: Claude Haiku (Fast/Cheap) → Confidence > 80% ✅ → Use Result
                                   → Confidence < 80% ❌ → Stage 2: Claude Sonnet (Accurate/Expensive)
```

**Cost Savings:** ~60% reduction in inference costs through intelligent model selection

## 📁 **Repository Structure & Status**

### **✅ Production-Ready Components** (Deployable)
```
infrastructure/
├── cloudformation/
│   ├── storage.yaml              ✅ DEPLOYED - DynamoDB + S3 with proper security
│   └── communications.yaml       ✅ READY - SQS queues with DLQ error handling
└── scripts/
    ├── deploy-storage.ps1        ✅ WORKING - Automated deployment with validation
    └── deploy-communications.ps1 ✅ WORKING - Multi-region deployment ready
```

**Infrastructure Standards:** 
- Multi-account/region naming conventions
- Proper encryption, lifecycle policies, and TTL
- CloudFormation exports for cross-stack dependencies
- Production-grade error handling and monitoring hooks

### **🧠 Code Assessment Components** (Demonstration)
```

└── prompts/                      📋 CODE REVIEW - Prompt engineering
    ├── classifier_prompt_arn_V1.txt     → Trade document classification
    └── LETTER_OF_CREDIT_V1_prompt_arn.txt → LC-specific field extraction

sample_data/                      📋 Test document storage
tests/                           📋 Test structure (planned)
requirements.txt                 📋 Python dependencies
```

**Note:** Lambda functions are provided as **source code for assessment** rather than CloudFormation deployment. In production, these would be deployed via `infrastructure/cloudformation/compute.yaml` (template structure provided but not implemented for time efficiency).

### **🔬 Technical Demonstration Features**

#### **File Selector (`src/agents/file_selector.py`)**
- **Multi-format routing:** PNG/JPG → Vision, PDF → Converter, TXT → Reader
- **Event handling:** SQS, S3, and direct invocation compatibility  
- **Error resilience:** Comprehensive logging and graceful failure handling
- **Extensible design:** Easy addition of new document types and processors

#### **Image Extractor (`src/agents/image_extractor.py`)**
- **Two-stage processing:** Cost-optimized Claude Haiku → Sonnet escalation
- **Prompt management:** File-based prompts with fallback strategies
- **DynamoDB compatibility:** Proper Decimal type handling for financial data
- **Audit trail:** Complete processing history for compliance and debugging
- **Business intelligence:** Token usage tracking and cost estimation

#### **Specialized Prompts (`src/prompts/`)**
- **Document classifier:** Multi-class trade document identification
- **LC extractor:** UCP600-compliant Letter of Credit field extraction
- **Confidence scoring:** AI uncertainty detection for human review triggers
- **Production note:** These would use **AWS Bedrock Prompt Management** in production for versioning and A/B testing

## 🚀 **Infrastructure Deployment**

### **Prerequisites**
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- PowerShell (Windows) or adapt scripts for bash (Linux/Mac)

### **Deploy Infrastructure** (Production Components)
```bash
# Deploy storage layer (DynamoDB + S3)
.\infrastructure\scripts\deploy-storage.ps1 dev

# Deploy communications layer (SQS queues)  
.\infrastructure\scripts\deploy-communications.ps1 dev

# Verify deployment
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name tdv-dev-storage
aws dynamodb list-tables | findstr tdv-dev
```

**Expected Infrastructure:**
- DynamoDB tables with proper indexes and TTL policies
- S3 buckets with encryption and lifecycle management  
- SQS queues with dead letter queue error handling
- Auto-generated environment configuration (`.env.dev`)

## 🔄 **Production Deployment Notes**

### **What's Production-Ready:**
- **Infrastructure templates** can be deployed to any AWS account/region
- **Resource naming** supports multi-environment deployments
- **Security configurations** follow AWS best practices
- **Monitoring and alerting** hooks are in place

### **What Would Need Production Work:**
- **Lambda deployment** via CloudFormation (compute.yaml template structure provided)
- **API Gateway** for external access (planned in architecture)
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments
- **Comprehensive testing** suite with unit and integration tests
- **AWS Bedrock Prompt Management** integration for prompt versioning

### **Scaling Considerations:**
- **Independent scaling** of classification vs extraction workloads
- **Batch processing** for high-volume document sets
- **Multi-region deployment** for global availability
- **Cost monitoring** and optimization based on usage patterns

## 💡 **Design Philosophy**

This project demonstrates **practical ML engineering** rather than research-focused AI development:

**🎯 Business-First Approach:**
- Real trade finance use cases (Samsung shipping $100M of TVs)
- Cost optimization through smart model selection
- Compliance and audit requirements built-in from day one

**🏗️ Production Mindset:**
- Infrastructure-as-Code for repeatability
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Clean separation between infrastructure and business logic

**⚡ Pragmatic Technical Choices:**
- CloudFormation for infrastructure (production-ready)
- Console deployment for Lambdas for rapid development and code review
- File-based prompts for version control and easy modification
