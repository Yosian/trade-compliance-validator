## 🏦 **Regulatory Knowledge Base Integration**

### **Advanced RAG Pipeline for Trade Finance Compliance**

The system leverages **AWS S3 Vectors** to create a comprehensive regulatory knowledge base that enhances document processing with real-world compliance intelligence:

#### **Knowledge Sources:**
- **🏛️ UCP600 Complete Documentation:** All 39 articles of ICC Documentary Credit rules
- **🏦 FCA Financial Services Register:** Authorized bank validation and risk scoring
- **📋 HMRC Trade Procedures:** UK customs and international trade requirements
- **⚖️ Trade Finance Regulations:** Compliance frameworks and validation rules

#### **RAG Enhancement Process:**
```
1. 📄 Document Processing: Extract fields using two-stage AI
2. 🔍 Regulatory Query: Query S3 Vectors knowledge base with extracted data
3. 🏦 Bank Validation: Real-time FCA authorization checking for LC banks
4. ⚖️ Compliance Check: UCP600 rule validation with automatic citations
5. 📊 Risk Assessment: ML-powered fraud prevention and risk scoring
6. 📋 Enhanced Results: Regulation-aware output with compliance audit trail
```

#### **Business Intelligence Integration:**
```python
# Example enhanced output with RAG integration
{
  "document_type": "LETTER_OF_CREDIT",
  "extracted_fields": {
    "issuing_bank": "HSBC Bank plc",
    "beneficiary": "Samsung Electronics",
    "amount": "USD 100,000,000"
  },
  "regulatory_validation": {
    "fca_bank_authorized": true,
    "ucp600_compliance_score": 0.95,
    "regulatory_citations": [
      "UCP600 Article 14a: Standard for Examination of Documents"
    ],
    "risk_assessment": "LOW",
    "fraud_prevention_checks": "PASSED"
  },
  "business_intelligence": {
    "processing_cost_optimized": "60% savings vs single-stage",
    "regulatory_knowledge_applied": true,
    "compliance_audit_ready": true
  }
}
```

### **Why RAG AFTER Document Processing:**
The regulatory knowledge base is queried **after** field extraction to:
- **Validate extracted bank names** against FCA authorization
- **Check LC compliance** against UCP600 regulations  
- **Provide regulatory context** for detected discrepancies
- **Generate compliance citations** for audit requirements
- **Assess fraud risk** based on regulatory intelligence

This approach ensures that AI-extracted data is **enhanced and validated** with authoritative regulatory knowledge, rather than biasing the initial extraction process.
