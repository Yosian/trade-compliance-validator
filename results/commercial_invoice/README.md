## üìå Observations

- The invoice structure (header + table + totals) makes it a valuable test case for layout-aware extraction.
- Claude performs well on block text, but struggles slightly with financial tables.
- Extraction of multiple line items worked, but formatting edge cases (e.g. comma-separated values) could affect parsing.

## ‚úÖ Next Actions

- Add post-processing logic to detect tabular data regions
- Improve value type coercion and validation
- Use this doc for evaluating table parsing improvements
