## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

1. **ACCURACY OVER COMPLETENESS**: Return null for uncertain fields rather than making assumptions
2. **DATE FORMAT**: Always use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
3. **CURRENCY**: Use standard three-letter currency codes
4. **DOCUMENTS**: List all required documents as separate array items
5. **CONFIDENCE**: Be honest about extraction confidence - low confidence helps identify documents needing human review

Focus on precision and flag any ambiguities for human expert review.
