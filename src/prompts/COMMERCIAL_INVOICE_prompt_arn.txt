## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

1. **ACCURACY OVER COMPLETENESS**: Do not guess. Use `null` where uncertain.
2. **DATE FORMAT**: Always return dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
3. **MONEY VALUES**: Use full currency + numeric amount (e.g., `"USD 1,200.00"`).
4. **STRUCTURE**: Always return line items as an array, even if only one.
5. **SIGNATURES**: Only extract visible human names or stamps.

Focus on high-precision extraction suitable for compliance review, accounting, and reconciliation.
