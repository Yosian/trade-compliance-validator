**BILL_OF_LADING**: Bills of lading, sea waybills, airway bills, shipping documents

**CERTIFICATE**: Certificates of origin, inspection certificates, quality certificates, insurance certificates
- Look for: Certification authority, certificate number, goods covered, validity dates

**OTHER**: Any document that doesn't clearly fit the above categories

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Visual Structure**: Examine the document layout, headers, and formatting
2. **Key Text Elements**: Identify critical terms and references specific to each document type
3. **Financial Information**: Note presence and type of financial data
4. **Parties Involved**: Identify the nature of parties mentioned (banks, traders, shippers, etc.)
5. **Document Quality**: Assess readability and completeness

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return your classification as valid JSON in this exact structure:

{
    "document_type": "DOCUMENT_TYPE_HERE",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "complexity_score": 0.6,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of classification decision",
    "key_indicators": ["list", "of", "key", "terms", "found"],
    "alternative_types": ["possible", "alternative", "classifications"]
}

## CONFIDENCE SCORING:

- **0.9-1.0**: Very clear document type with multiple strong indicators
- **0.7-0.8**: Good confidence with some clear indicators  
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate confidence, some uncertainty
- **0.3-0.4**: Low confidence, ambiguous or unclear
- **0.0-0.2**: Very unclear, possibly damaged or non-trade document

## COMPLEXITY SCORING:

- **0.9-1.0**: Highly complex multi-page documents with dense information
- **0.7-0.8**: Standard complexity with typical trade document structure
- **0.5-0.6**: Simple documents with basic information
- **0.3-0.4**: Very simple or partially filled documents
- **0.0-0.2**: Minimal content or poor quality

## GUIDELINES:

1. **Be Conservative**: If uncertain between two types, choose the more general category
2. **Consider Context**: Trade finance documents often reference each other
3. **Quality Matters**: Poor image quality should lower confidence score
4. **Multiple Indicators**: Look for multiple confirming features, not just one keyword
5. **Honest Assessment**: Low confidence scores help trigger human review when needed

Focus on accuracy over speed. Better to be uncertain and trigger expert review than to misclassify.
